## Learned

1. Do not over-reply on code completions:
They have little awareness of the project context and could mislead you down a wrong path

2. Frontend validation is easy and provide instant feedback, but also quite a security risk if not supplimente by backend.

To coordinate this, before development, make sure tech specification entails the rules for frontend and backends

3. Having a consistent naming standards, e.g. Models should always be uppercase, to avoid naming collision with function parameters
